This is the ASP Net web application about an Iowan native cat named Sailor.

The application created during a crash course on web app .NET development and automated CI/CD deployment to Azure. 

The training course covered a range of topics, starting with the development of a fun website using C# in Visual Studio. 
It included creating automated tests (MVC testing, xUnit frameworks), publishing code to GitHub, creating workflows using GitHub Actions, and automating the deployment of the website to an Azure container application. 

You can check out the project here:
